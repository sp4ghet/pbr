# OpenGL Stuff


![](./docs/images/capture.png)

For now starting off by following [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).

Required libraries:
- glfw3
- assimp

(Find source and compile yourself or find binaries to link to them.)


model class plans:
- load vertices and indices using assimp
- load textures manually (add a method)
    - something like `loadTexture(string uniformName, string path)`
