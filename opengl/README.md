# OpenGL Stuff

For now starting off by following [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).
Compiling this on other platforms should be basically the same as windows, but you'll probably need to recompile `glfw3.lib` or find a binary.
There might be some stuff to do with OpenGL that has yet to be implemented.
